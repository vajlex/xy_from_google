### Browse Map

This version provides a basic .html map which can be panned and zoomed, while the marker always remains in the center of the map.

Once the marker is aligned with the correct location, click SUBMIT to print the x, y coordinates in several formats to screen.


### Query Placename

This version provides a form for searching by placenames.  Enter a placename (container units are allowed, for example:  Springfield, MO).   

The first hit in the Google Geocoder API will be presented on the Google Maps for browsing.

Similar to the other version, once the location is correct, click SUBMIT to print the values to screen.

An optional label (name) is available as one of the form variables that is printed to screen.  (The default label is the "long name" from the Google location.)
